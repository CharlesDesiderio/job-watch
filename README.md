# Job Watch

This is a small application that keeps track of the jobs you've applied for and where you are in the interview process.

# Usage

This project saves all data to your local storage. At present, there is no database access or user authentication. Please be aware that if you're relying on this to save your data, it is all stored locally on your computer.

# Future Updates

I may still add database and authentication in the future, but as present, there is not ETA for this.

# Contributing

Feel free to either fork and build your own version of this, or add any functionality that you feel may be missing.
